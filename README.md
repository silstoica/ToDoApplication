# ToDoApplication
A simple To-Do web application with basic CRUD operations and login form.

## Getting Started

- Change the URL for the database, from the application.properties file, with the one on your computer, which points to the tasks.db file.

### Prerequisites

A Java running IDE

### Installing

After changing the URL for the database, run the Maven goal: mvn clean install, to download the necessary libraries from pom.xml and run the application.


After the application started you can check out how it works by accessing from the browser the following URL: localhost:8080.

## Running the tests

You can run each Unit Test individually by clicking the green arrow on the right of each test beginning or all of them when you run the entire application.

The Unit Tests test the service layer of the application.
